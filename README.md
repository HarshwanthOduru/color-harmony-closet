- **Complementary Colors**: Opposite colors on color wheel (150¬∞-210¬∞ difference) ‚Üí +2 points
- **Analogous Colors**: Close colors on color wheel (‚â§30¬∞ difference) ‚Üí +1 point  
- **High Contrast**: Light vs dark combinations (L<30 vs L>70) ‚Üí +1 point

- **Style Preferences**: 
  - Formal: Favors neutrals and lower saturation
  - Casual: Rewards vibrant, bold combinations

## üé® Color Harmony Algorithm Explained

### Color Space Conversion
1. **RGB ‚Üí HSL**: Convert image colors to Hue, Saturation, Lightness for better color analysis
2. **Hue Distance**: Calculate minimal angular difference on color wheel (0-180¬∞)

### Harmony Rules Implementation
```javascript
// Complementary colors (opposite on wheel)
if (hueDistance >= 150 && hueDistance <= 210) {
    score += 2; // Strong harmony
}

// Analogous colors (neighbors on wheel)  
else if (hueDistance <= 30) {
    score += 1; // Gentle harmony
}

// High contrast (light + dark)
if ((lightness1 < 30 && lightness2 > 70) || vice versa) {
    score += 1; // Good contrast
}

// Neutral pairing bonus
if (isNeutral(color1) || isNeutral(color2)) {
    if (formalContext) score += 1; // Neutrals preferred in formal
}
```

### Style-Specific Scoring
- **Formal**: Bonus for neutrals, penalty for high saturation (>55%)
- **Casual**: Bonus for vibrant colors and complementary combinations

## üíæ Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage:

- **Wardrobe Items**: `wardrobe_items` key stores uploaded clothing with extracted color data
- **Saved Outfits**: `saved_outfits` key stores favorite outfit combinations  
- **App Settings**: `app_settings` key for user preferences

No external servers or databases required!
